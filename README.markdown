# Buildkit

My own buildkit, idea taken from [git://git.drupal.org/project/buildkit.git][1] with a bunch of modifications.

See [http://drupalcode.org/project/buildkit.git][2].

A lot of extra changes made with looking at Wiredcraft's version.

See [https://github.com/Wiredcraft/buildkit][3].

Overall I've taken their ideas and applied it to my own situation and how we need to create drupal installations.
